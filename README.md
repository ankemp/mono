# Mono

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx).

This mono-repo was created to facilitate creating the projects that I like to experiment with but quit because I end up having to re-write or copy code from other projects that I'm working on, started but never finished, or gave up on completely.

This is an effort to standardize a lot of my code, and let me build apps and create side projects much faster.

I might be publishing a few of the libraries from here, but no promises on that.
